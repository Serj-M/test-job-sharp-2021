Successful test assignment for full stack developer (c#) position in 2021.

Functionality and requirements for the project:

Need to make a website on ASP.NET Core 5.0 technologies with the following requirements:

- A single-page site containing text, a picture and some js functionality.
- The layout must be as W3C compliant as possible.
- The image must be in svg format and embedded in the page body.
- There should be at least one controller on the backend that is referenced. If there are any templated controllers, a new one should be added and explicitly announced.
- It should be possible to change the language without reloading the page. The localization should be stored in a separate json file for easy editing.
- Both backend (C#) and frontend (js) should have at least one autotest.
- There should be a Dockerfile in the root of the repository for packaging in a docker image and then simply running.

All other content and site design is up to you.
